# CampaignRandomizer
Just a silly little campaign randomizer for my pathfinder group

Uses python 2.7.1. Not compatible with Python 3.x, unless you feel like modifiying all of the print statements.
This is not meant to be good, just something to kill some time.

May be updated in the future with more ideas. May also be integrated into a website.
